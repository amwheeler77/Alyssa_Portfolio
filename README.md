# [Project 1: Breast Cancer Review](https://github.com/amwheeler77/Breast-Cancer-Review)
This project uses various data mining techniques on a breast cancer patient dataset. Some of these mining techniques include creating tables and graphs, decision trees, classification, regression, cluster analysis, anomaly detection, association, and neural networks. The goal of this project was to find any helpful patterns for cancer patients.

# [Project 2: Genetic Insights into Plain Community](https://github.com/amwheeler77/Genetic-Insights-into-Plain-Community)
Project creates a genetic variant database derived from the exome sequences of 210 Kish Valley Amish and Mennonite individuals. With a focus on identifying potentially harmful mutations, both genome-wide and within specific genes of clinical interest, the database was analyzed further in Rstudio.

# [Project 3: Malaria in Hawaiian Birds](https://github.com/amwheeler77/Malaria_Hawaiian_Birds)
Project analyzes data from 2018-2021 Hawaii in RStudio. It looks at the prevalence of avian malaria in Hawaiian Archipelago. The data is from the USGS website. The main purpose of the study was to look at how location affects the prevalence of malaria.

# [Project 4: Mutation in ABCG8 and ABCG5](https://github.com/amwheeler77/Mutation_ABCG8_ABCG5)
Project looks at mutations in ABCG8 and ABCG5 in correlation with Sitosterolemia in the Plain Population. The goal was to analyzed Variant Call Files (VCF) to look for gene mutations of a possible correlation in connection of a single disease using the exome sequencing of 99 Plain community patients.

# [Project 5: Save Student Information](https://github.com/amwheeler77/Student_Info)
Project uses Python to take in student information and adds student to CSV file. It prompts the user whether student is new or existing to see what information is needed. There are a few examples at the very end.
